## DevOps Stages

1. Version Control: It maintains different versions of the code. Keeps track of code commits, which devlopers has committed what, we can go to previous version anytime too.  
		Example : Git, SVN
2. Continuous Integration: This includes: Compile, validate, Code Review, Unit Testing(testing each part of code), Integration Testing (how different parts of project work together), making a package 
		Note that: These all tasks falls under build category too.
	
3. Continuous Delivery: Also Continous Testing. This step basically considers: Deploying the build application to test servers. 

4. Continuous Deployment: Deploying the tested application on the production server for release.
